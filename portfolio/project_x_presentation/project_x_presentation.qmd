## Background

### Context

-   Focus on Global South: Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, etc.

-   Low income Countries: More affected by aid, variance in impacts depending on income levels

    ![](figures/WLD-income-map.png){width="728"}

    source: *World Bank*

## Background

### Research Questions

-   Foreign aid continues to be a primary tool of global engagement

-   Few studies fully integrate regime type, donor leverage, and transparency outcomes all together.

-   Can lead to more of an understanding in terms of how to fulfill donor goals in various regime types

## Research Question

How does foreign aid affect corruption in varying regime types?

# Literature {background-color="#40666e"}

## Literature

-   **Camp One:** more corruption in autocracies, minimal to no impact on democracies

    -- *Kono et al., 2009*

    -- *Nieto-Matiz et. al. ,2020*

-   **Camp Two:** Aid always causes corruption: regime type has no impact

    -- *Knack, 2003*

    -- *Kaylvitis et al., 2012*

    -- *Bader et al., 201*

-   **Camp Three:** Donor intent matters not regime type

    -- *Bermeo, 2011*

    -- *Brown, 2005*

# Empirics {background-color="#40666e"}

## Empirics

### Argument and Theory

-   Autocracies: Lack of voter base leads to uncontrolled growth in corruption

-   Democracies: Corruption increases, need to appease voter base decreases it

## Empirics

### Data

**Figure A:**

![](figures/FigureA.png)

Sources: Transparency International: CPI, World Bank: Income Level and Percent GNI of ODA, V-Dem: Regime Classification

Approach: Differences in Differences:

$$
\text{CPI}_{it} = \sum_{k = -4}^{10} \beta_k \cdot \mathbb{1}(\text{EventTime}_{it} = k) + \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

-   $\text{CPI}_{it}$: is the corruption score for country $i$ in year $t$,

-   $\mathbb{1}(\text{EventTime}_{it} = k)$: indicator for each year relative to treatment. -$\alpha_i$: Country fixed effects -$\gamma_t$-:year fixed effects are included to account for time-invariant country characteristics and common shocks.

**Figure C:**

## Empirics

### Data

**Figure D: add figure D when you figure out how to fix the N/A thing**

## Empirics

### Findings

-   Figure A: two contrasting trends:

    -- Democracies: corruption decreases after an initial spike,

    -- Autocracies: corruption steadily worsens following the aid shock

-   Figure B: democracies have more of a lag: shows institutional checks, shows why corruption improvement in figure A is not immediate in democracies

-   Figure C:

    -- Autocracies: Aid goes in short term sectors,

    -- Democracies: Aid goes to government

-   Figure D: Protests in both

    -- Democracies: decrease in corruption

    -- Autocracies: corruption continues to increase

# Limitations and Critiques {background-color="#40666e"}

## Limitations and Critqiues

-   Difference-in-Differences event study assumes that treated and control countries would have followed similar paths in the absence of high ODA inflows

-  Excludes sub-national differences:
    
    -- Somaliland
-   CPI is a perception-based measure, which may lag behind actual corruption changes or be biased by media coverage and international scrutiny.
-   Ignores Conditionality
-   Future studies could look at:

    -- Sub-national variation
   
    -- Diffrent economic levels
  
    -- Donor type: Members of OPEC versus external sources i.e Chinao
