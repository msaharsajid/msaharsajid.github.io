Hi! I am Data Analyst, currently attending Parkway South High. I have a passion for public policy and data analytics. With a solid background in R programming, data analysis, visualization, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), I’m ready to tackle the complex challenges at the intersection of data and public policy. On this website, you’ll find a showcase of my projects, demonstrating my ability to analyze societal issues, visualize data trends, and propose actionable recommendations for policy improvements. Click on relevant categories to see these projects.
